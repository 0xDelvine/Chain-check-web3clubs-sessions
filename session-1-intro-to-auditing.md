# üõ† Session 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Smart Contract Auditing

## üîç What is a Smart Contract Audit?

A **smart contract audit** is a comprehensive security review of a contract's source code and architecture to identify vulnerabilities before or after deployment. It typically includes:

* Business logic verification
* Access control validation
* Economic/exploit simulations
* Manual code review and test reproduction
* Use of automated tooling (static analysis, fuzzing)
* Threat modeling and adversarial thinking

Audits **reduce risk**, **build trust**, and are a **non-negotiable step** before launching production smart contracts.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Audits Are Critical in Web3

Web3 is trustless, permissionless, and high-stakes. Smart contracts:

* Often secure millions to billions in value
* Cannot be patched like traditional systems
* Are exposed to a global adversarial audience 24/7

**Consequences of no/faulty audits**:

* Fund drains (flash loans, logic errors, faulty access control)
* Protocol takeovers (governance exploits)
* User trust loss and regulatory scrutiny


## üß† Security Researcher vs Smart Contract Auditor

| Role        | Security Researcher                  | Smart Contract Auditor                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Focus       | Exploiting unknown bugs in the wild  | Preventing exploits before or after deployment |
| Process     | Open-ended, CTF-style investigation  | Structured, scoped, spec-aligned review        |
| Deliverable | PoCs, CVEs, writeups, bounty reports | Formal reports with severity + mitigation      |
| Environment | Deployed protocols, public targets   | Both deployed and protocols on testing phase.  |


## üéØ Bug Bounty vs Audit

| Factor    | Bug Bounty                      | Formal Audit                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Stage     | Post-deploy                     | Pre-deploy (usually)                     |
| Reviewers | Global community (crowdsourced) | Expert auditors (internal/external team) |
| Incentive | Pay-per-vuln                    | Paid engagement                          |
| Guarantee | Opportunistic coverage          | Deterministic & scoped coverage          |


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Categories

### üß† Logic Flaws

* Misaligned reward distribution
* Incomplete validation (e.g., uncapped mint, unrestricted governance)
* Incorrect accounting/overflows with `unchecked` math

### üß® Low-level Security Flaws

* Reentrancy (`call.value()` patterns or state-modification ordering)
* Storage collisions in proxies
* Delegatecall injection
* Malicious approvals (ERC20 nuances)


## üìÑ Structure of a Professional Audit Report

1. **Executive Summary**

   * Protocol overview, scope, methodology, findings count by severity

2. **Findings Section**

   * Each issue includes:

     * Title, severity, impacted contracts
     * Explanation of vulnerability
     * Technical PoC
     * Impact & likelihood
     * Suggested mitigation

3. **Fix Status**

   * Acknowledged / Fixed / Partially Fixed

4. **Appendices**

   * Threat models, gas optimizations, tool versions
